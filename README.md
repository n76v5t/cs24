Women at Work Page 6The University of Sydney “Using a gender lens brings many issues to the fore,

but none more frequently than work patterns that create

painful conflicts between work and personal life for

both men and women” (Rapoport et al 2002:11) Why look at gender in organisations through a

gender lens? Page 7The University of Sydney – Paid work: work done for pay, part-time, full-time, contract,

self-employed – Unpaid work: housework and caring work, done without pay,

and usually by women.

– Inequality markers (Baird  Heron 2019): working hours gap,

gender pay gap and superannuation gap

– Gender pay gap: measures the difference between the

average earnings of women and men in the workforce

Concepts Page 8The University of Sydney – Superannuation (‘Super’): Retirement savings in Australia,

paid by employer, 10% of salary – Occupational Gender Segregation: describes how the

workforce in Australia is segregated by gender.

– Female dominated industries = healthcare, social assistance,

education and training –Male dominated industries = construction and transport,

mining, electricity, gas, water Concepts continued Page 10The University of Sydney Inequality markers (Baird  Heron, 2019) ? Working Hours Gap: More

women work part-time hours

than men ? Gender Pay Gap: Australian

women earn less than

Australian men ? Superannuation Gap:

Working Hours Gap Women’s Workforce Participation (WGEA 2022) – 59.5% of tertiary education enrollments are women – 47.9% of all employed persons in Australia are women – Yet women make up 68.5% of all part-time employees – Some choose to work part-time – Childcare costs high – Tax incentive structures – Workforce participation rate = 62.1% women and 70.4%

men Inequality Markers (Baird and Heron 2019) Page 12The University of Sydney 2. Gender Pay Gap: measures the difference between the

average earnings of women and men in the workforce

– Equal Pay: equal pay for work of equal or comparable value – Calculated yearly by WGEA using ABS data

13.8 % National Gender Pay Gap (WGEA 2022) – Women’s average weekly ordinary full-time earnings across

all industries and occupations = $1591.20 vs men’s at

$1846.50 (difference of $255.3 per week) Inequality Markers (Baird and Heron代 写program 、 c++，java

gap? Page 24The University of Sydney Link between men’s contribution to unpaid domestic work and

gender equality: – Women can work more hours in paid work – Decreases within household gender pay gap – Shifts societal norms around gender roles – Benefits to children, girls, fathers, organisations and society – Daughters of mothers who worked more likely to earn higher

incomes

– Father benefits: health, wellbeing, better relationships with

children –Organisations: productive employees, satisfied with worklife

balance Women’s disproportionate share of unpaid domestic

and caring work Page 25The University of Sydney – Workplace flexibility and paternity leave encourage men’s

participation in unpaid domestic work

– And, recent research in Australia has found that young men have

a desire to be involved fathers (Hill et al 2019) –Workplace flexibility – Paternity leave is time men take off upon the birth of the child

– Yet uptake of both workplace flexibility and paternity leave by

men are low in Australia (Borgkvist et al 2018; Moran 

Koslowski 2019, WGEA 2020) Men’s access to and uptake of workplace flexibility

and paternity leave Page 26The University of Sydney – Men face barriers when they try to access due to: – Ideal/Universal worker norm (Acker 1990) – Co-worker/managerial perceptions (Borgkvist et al 2018) – Flexibility stigma (Coltrane et al 2013) – Reserved for women (Crabb 2019, Borgkvist et al 2018,

Coltrane et al 2013; Rehel 2014). – Men, the gig economy, flexible work and gender roles Men’s access to and uptake of workplace flexibility

and paternity leave Page 27The University of Sydney 1. Working Hours Gap 2. Gender Pay Gap 3. Superannuation Gap Back to the Inequality Markers… (Baird  Heron

2019) Page 28The University of Sydney 3. Superannuation Gap Superannuation (‘Super’): Retirement savings in Australia, paid

by employer, 11% of salary Superannuation gap = 20.5% (WGEA 2020) – More elderly women living in poverty

– Increase over 30% in homelessness of elderly women – Lower levels of financial literacy make money management

difficult

One more gap: Leadership Gap

Inequality Markers (Baird and Herson 2019) Page 29The University of Sydney – Inequality markers perpetuated by policy, gender norms and

organistions that favour the ideal/universal worker – Women do more unpaid caring and domestic work than men – There is a link between men’s participation in domestic and

caring work and gender equality – When men try to access enablers of this (flexible work and

parental leave) they face barriers – Recent research finds that young Australian men want to

participate in unpaid work; organisations shifting policies around

this – helps both men and women! – But the current state still plagued by inequality markers: hours

gap, gender pay gap and Superannuation gap – …And leadership gap! To conclude men and women at work Page 40The University of Sydney Questions? The University of Sydney Thank You!
